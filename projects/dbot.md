### Context
**Purpose:** for fun!

My friend and former Cornell Glee Club webmaster, Collin Montag, created a python chatbot for the Cornell Glee Club group chat on GroupMe. It responded to certain commands and often led to perfectly-timed jokes. I drew inspiration from his creation, named "mbot", and decided to create my own python bot for one of the subset group chats I was in (GLOZZ- Glee Club and Chorus Class of 2022).

It was approaching the end of the school year and, as a distraction from my finals, I finished the first version and kept polishing it for a few weeks. I named it "dbot" after my friend Dubem, who was one of my biggest supporters. Dbot can initiate actions in response to commands, send messages in response to keywords, and pull information from the internet.

### Accomplishments
**Technologies:** Python Flask, Heroku, Web APIs

I was honestly a bit rusty when I took on this project. I worked with Python scripting in my sophomore year of high school and hadn't touched it since. My pythonic knowledge was limited (I had never worked with Flask before). I read through so many help pages and  python tutorials, faking it until I made it. Through a few specific GroupMe bot tutorials, I successfully created a basic bot that ran on a local server (hosted on my computer). It could send messages to my personal testing group chat. This was a huge success to me, but I didn't want to waste resources keeping my computer on for the bot.

I looked up how to host my project for free on the cloud but, unfortunately, most of the results cost money. Then I found Heroku, with its one-dyno limit per account. It was perfect for a small project like dbot. Several tutorials later, I added the necessary files to run my app on Heroku. I learned about the Heroku CLI and pushed my project online. After a bunch of testing, I had deployed my first Heroku app.

Along the way, I also learned so much about Web APIs (not only GroupMe's API, but also weather and transportation APIs). That then led to learning about things like HTTP requests, access tokens, environmental variables, and app security. I also did a significant amount of JSON manipulation. This project definitely made me more well-rounded and experienced as a developer.

### Reflection
**Verdict:** future plans in store

Although this was a relatively simple project, it taught me how to learn from online resources and how to manage my workflow. I'm really proud of dbot and I plan on creating my own tutorial, maybe to save less-experienced programmers from the research. This project also got me really interested in electronics, and I bought a Raspberry Pi to act as a server for more personal bots in the future.

In hindsight, testing was very tedious. Every time I wanted to upgrade dbot, I would have to redirect the group chat ID to my testing group chat. Then for all the commands I added or upgraded, I had to message a prompt and wait for an expected response. If I were to start this project from scratch, the testing methodology would probably be the number one thing I would change to improve my workflow.

Obviously, as with every project, there is a huge list of cool things I want to add. For as long as my group chat enjoys dbot, I will keep updating and pushing new versions. Maybe I'll move on to other messaging services like Discord.
